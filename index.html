        <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time!</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Adventure isn’t just about thrill — it’s about truly feeling alive.
          Activities like biking, paragliding, and surfing push you beyond your
          comfort zone, teaching you courage, focus, and resilience. The rush of
          wind on your face, the roar of waves beneath your board, or the view
          from a thousand feet up remind you how vast and beautiful life is.
          Every adventure challenges your limits and builds confidence that
          spills into every part of your life. It disconnects you from routine,
          reconnects you with nature, and sharpens your mind to live in the
          moment. Adventure sports don’t just test your body — they free your
          spirit, awaken curiosity, and remind you that fear and excitement
          often come from the same spark.

          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Biking is more than a sport — it’s a journey of freedom, endurance,
          and self-discovery. With every turn of the pedal, you feel the world
          unfold around you — the changing landscapes, the rhythm of your
          breath, and the sense of motion that clears your mind. Whether it’s
          cruising through city streets or tackling rugged mountain trails,
          biking builds strength, focus, and patience. It teaches balance — not
          just on two wheels, but in life. The hum of the tires, the wind
          rushing past, and the quiet satisfaction after a long ride remind you
          that progress comes one push at a time. Biking isn’t just travel —
          it’s therapy on wheels.<br /><br />It challenges your endurance,
          strengthens your body, and calms your mind. Whether you’re racing down
          a mountain trail, exploring unknown paths, or riding through the early
          morning quiet, biking teaches discipline, balance, and presence. It’s
          where exhaustion meets satisfaction, and effort turns into
          exhilaration — a perfect blend of adventure, freedom, and self-growth.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the purest form of flight — a breathtaking blend of
          freedom, courage, and serenity. As you run toward the edge and lift
          off, the world below transforms into a vast canvas of colors and
          patterns. The wind becomes your companion, the sky your playground.
          Suspended between earth and clouds, every heartbeat syncs with the
          rhythm of the air. .<br /><br />It’s not just an extreme sport — it’s
          a moment of surrender and control coexisting perfectly. Paragliding
          teaches trust: in your skill, your gear, and the forces of nature. The
          silence up there isn’t empty — it’s filled with awe, clarity, and
          perspective. Every flight is a reminder that sometimes, you have to
          let go of the ground to truly feel alive

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a dance between you and the ocean — a powerful mix of
          balance, patience, and pure exhilaration. As you paddle out and catch
          your first wave, time seems to slow down; every sense sharpens, and
          you feel completely alive. The ocean tests your strength and calm,
          teaching you to flow with its rhythm rather than fight against it.
          Each wave is different, unpredictable, and that’s what makes it
          magical — no two rides are ever the same. Surfing connects you deeply
          with nature, grounding you in its vastness and power. It builds
          resilience through every wipeout and joy through every perfect glide.
          Beyond sport, surfing becomes meditation in motion — a reminder that
          freedom comes when you learn to move with life’s waves, not against
          them..<br /><br />Every paddle out challenges your endurance; every
          wave you catch rewards your patience. The rush of dropping into a
          wave, the spray on your face, and the pull of the current awaken
          something primal — a connection to the earth’s raw energy. Surfing
          teaches humility, because the ocean always has the final say, yet it
          also gives a sense of liberation no land can offer. It’s not about
          mastering the waves, but about becoming one with them — finding peace,
          balance, and freedom in every ride.
